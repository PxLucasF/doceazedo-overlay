## 📝 Notes

- This is in **constant development** and I'm always open for new features ideas and pull requests! 🥳
- This is **not intended for others to use** by themselves, but if you really want to, keep in mind it has fixed sizings and your desktop resolution should be `1440x1080` and your stream output `1920x1080`. 🖥️

## 🧰 Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Create a [Spotify app](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and grab your [refresh token](https://benwiz.com/blog/create-spotify-refresh-token) with the `user-read-currently-playing` scope.
4. Create a [Twitch app](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app) and grab an [OAuth token](https://twitchapps.com/tokengen) - this can be from your personal account or any other, as no messages will be sent from it - with the following scopes: `chat:read chat:edit channel:moderate whispers:read whispers:edit channel_editor channel:read:subscriptions`.
5. Optionally yet highly recommended, setup the [SucoBOT](https://github.com/doceazedo/suco-bot).

## 🤹‍♂️ Usage

You can start the production server with:

```bash
